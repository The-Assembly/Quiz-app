# Quiz-app

Assuming that Node is installed, you can use npm to install the create-react-native-app command line utility:
**Step 1:** ```npm install -g create-react-native-app```
**Step 2:** ```npm install -g npm@4.6.1``` 

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "QuizApp":
**Step 3:** ```create-react-native-app QuizApp```
(should take some time)
**Step 4:** transfer the github files, **scr** folder and the **App.js** to your "QuizApp" directory.
**Step 5:** ```cd QuizApp```

Install two node modules
**Step 6:** ```npm install --save react-native-router-flux react-native-elements```

## Running your React Native application

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. Using the Expo app, scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.

**Step 7:** npm start
